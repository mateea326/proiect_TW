    <h1>About the episode</h1><br>
    <p>"Nosedive" is the first episode in the third series of Black Mirror. Michael Schur and
        Rashida Jones wrote the teleplay for the episode. It premiered on Netflix on 21 October 2016,
        alongside the rest of the third series. The episode is set in a world where people can rate each
        other from one to five stars for every interaction they have, which can impact their socioeconomic status.

    <h1>Plot</h1><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Society has embraced a technology wherein everyone shares their daily activities through eye implants and
                mobile devices and rates their interactions with others on a scale of one to five stars,
                cumulatively affecting everyone's socioeconomic status.</p>
            <p>Lacie is a young woman overly obsessed with her ratings; she finds an opportunity to elevate her ratings
                greatly and move into a more luxurious residence after being chosen by her popular childhood
                friend as the maid of honour for her wedding.</p>
            <p>She seeks to raise her 4.2 rating to 4.5 for a discount on a luxury apartment. However, despite her
                attempts
                to be outgoing and pleasant, her rating has plateaued.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>On the day of her flight, several mishaps cause people to rate Lacie negatively, dropping her rating.
                At the airport, her flight is cancelled and she cannot buy a seat on another flight with her current
                rating. Because of her low rating, Lacie can only rent an older car to drive to the
                wedding, which she cannot recharge when it runs out of power. She is forced to hitchhike with a truck
                driver
                with a rating of 1.4, who tells Lacie that she used to care about her rating until her late husband had
                passed
                away from cancer because their scores were deemed not high enough for the treatment; she says she feels
                much
                freer without obsessing over ratings.</p>
            <p>Lacie reaches the wedding, grabs the microphone and starts giving the speech she had written but causes a
                scene. The guests rate Lacie negatively, causing her rating to fall below one star.
                Lacie is imprisoned with her eye implants removed. She and the man in the cell opposite hers
                realise they can now speak without worrying about being rated, and they shout insults at each other.</p>
