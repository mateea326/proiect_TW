    <h1>About the episode</h1><br>
    <p>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch is a 2018 interactive film in the science fiction anthology series Black Mirror.
        It was written by series creator Charlie Brooker and directed by David Slade. The film premiered on Netflix
        on 28 December 2018, its release date only officially announced the day before.</p>
    <p>In Bandersnatch, viewers make decisions for the main character, the young programmer Stefan Butler
        who is adapting a fantasy gamebook into a video game in 1984. A postmodernist work with free will as a
        central theme, the film was named after a real video game planned for release by Imagine Software in 1984,
        the game in turn named after the bandersnatch, a creature of Lewis Carroll's creation.</p>
    <h1>Plot</h1><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>In Britain in July 1984, a young programmer named Stefan Butler is adapting a "choose your own
                adventure"
                book owned by his late mother, Bandersnatch by Jerome F. Davies, into a revolutionary adventure
                game.
                Stefan pitches it to the video game company Tuckersoft, and is given the choice of accepting or
                rejecting
                help from the company in developing the game. If Stefan accepts, the famous game creator Colin
                Ritman
                says he chose the "wrong path". Stefan considers trying again, and the film returns to the day of
                the offer,
                and the viewer is given the same choice.</p>
            <p>Rejecting the offer, Stefan begins to work on the game on his own from his bedroom.
                As the game becomes more complex, Stefan becomes stressed. He visits Dr.Haynes' clinic for therapy.
                The viewer may have Stefan explain to Dr. Haynes about his mother's death: when he
                was five, his dad confiscated his stuffed rabbit toy. His mother was delayed by Stefan's refusal to
                leave without the rabbit and the train she took derailed, killing her. Stefan feels responsible for
                her death. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>The viewer may have Stefan accept an invitation to Colin's flat, where they take hallucinogens and
                Colin rants about secret government mind-control programs and alternate timelines.
                To demonstrate his theories, Colin demands Stefan choose one of them to jump off the
                balcony. If Stefan jumps, he dies and the game is finished by Tuckersoft to poor reviews.
                If Colin jumps, the whole encounter is revealed to be a dream, but Colin is absent in future scenes.
            </p>
            <p>Stefan begins to feel he is being controlled by outside forces. As he begins to mentally break down,
                the viewer has multiple options to explain to Stefan who has been controlling him,
                including the option for Stefan to be told that he is being watched on Netflix in the 21st century.
                The viewer may discover a locked safe that contains either Stefan's old toy rabbit or documents
                about him being monitored as part of an experiment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>There are numerous possible endings. Stefan may choose to fight his therapist, after which it may be
                revealed that he is in a film set and that his "dad" is a fellow actor.
                One set of choices leads to Stefan seemingly
                crossing through a mirror to his five-year-old self to "die" with his mother in the train crash,
                causing him to
                suddenly die in the present. In other paths, the viewer has the option to make Stefan kill his
                father,
                which either leads to Stefan being jailed before the release of the game or
                to the successful release of the game, but Stefan goes to prison shortly afterwards and the game is
                recalled and destroyed. In some endings, the viewer is shown the critical reaction to the
                Bandersnatch
                game and the fate of Tuckersoft, which may go out of business. Other endings conclude in the present
                day
                with a programmer for Netflix, attempting to adapt Bandersnatch into an interactive film. The viewer
                chooses for her to pour tea over her computer or destroy it, which implies she may go down the same
                path Stefan did.</p>
