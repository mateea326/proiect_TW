    <h1>Plot</h1><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Martha Powell and Ash Starmer are a young couple who have moved to
                Ash's remote family house in the countryside. The day after moving in, Ash is killed while
                returning the
                hired van. At the funeral, Martha's friend, Sarah, talks about a new online service
                which helped her in a similar situation. Martha yells at her, but Sarah signs Martha up anyway.
                After
                discovering she is pregnant, Martha tries it out. Using all of Ash's past online
                communications and social media profiles, the service creates a new virtual "Ash".
                Starting out with
                instant messaging, Martha uploads more videos and photos and begins to talk with the artificial
                Ash over
                the phone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Martha accidentally drops her phone and
                temporarily loses contact with the artificial Ash. After consoling her, the artificial Ash
                tells her
                about the service's experimental stage.
                Following his instructions, Martha turns a blank, synthetic body
                into an android that looks almost exactly identical to Ash.

                One night, she orders the robot Ash to leave and is annoyed that he does so,
                as the real Ash would have
                resisted. The next morning, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders him
                to jump off. As he
                begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have
                simply obeyed. The
                android begs for its life and Martha screams.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Several years later, it is Martha's daughter's birthday. Martha keeps the Ash android
                locked in the attic and only allows her daughter to see the android on weekends, but she makes an
                exception for her birthday. Her daughter chats away to the android while Martha stands at the
                bottom of
                the attic steps, and forces herself to join them.</p>
