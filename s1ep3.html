  <h1>About the episode</h1><br>
  <p>"The Entire History of You" is the third and final episode of the first series of Black Mirror.
    It was the first episode written by sitcom writer Jesse Armstrong.
    Directed by Brian Welsh, the episode premiered on Channel 4 on 18 December 2011.</p>
  <h1>Plot</h1><br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <p>The episode is set in a future where a "grain" technology records people's audiovisual senses, allowing a
        person to re-watch their memories. The episode was designed to be set in 2050,
        with stone, wood and metal materials featuring heavily in the sets. </p>
      <p>Lawyer Liam Foxwell attends a performance appraisal. Agonising over it, he repeatedly watches the "re-do"
        on his "grain", an implant which records footage from his eyes and ears. Arriving at a dinner party for his
        wife Ffion and her friends, he finds her laughing with Jonas. Another guest talks about how she lacks a
        grain after an attacker cut into the skin behind her right ear to steal her memories.
        Improper removal of the grain can blind the victim.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <p>Liam asks Ffion about Jonas, and she says they dated for a month, but Liam shows a
        memory of her saying that she dated him for a week. Liam interrogates Ffion further and she says that her
        relationship with Jonas lasted six months. Liam drives to Jonas' house. Acting aggressively he
        hits Jonas in a tussle. </p>
      <p>Liam spots Jonas' memory of Ffion in bed. He asks Ffion about it. She lies at every step until Liam
        presses further: Ffion confesses that it was around the time their daughter was conceived.
        Aggressively, Liam demands she plays the memory, and she does.</p>
      <p>Later, in an empty house, Liam re-watches memories of Ffion and his daughter.
        He uses a razor blade and tweezers to remove his grain, and the screen cuts to black as he pulls it out.</p>
