    <h1>About the episode</h1><br>
    <p>"Hang the DJ" is the fourth episode of Black Mirror. It was
        written by Charlie Brooker and directed by Tim Van Patten. The episode first aired on Netflix,
        along with the rest of series four, on 29 December 2017. It follows Amy and Frank, who are
        matched into relationships for fixed lengths of time by an algorithm that eventually determines
        their life-long partner.</p>
    <p>The episode was inspired by the streaming service Spotify, as Brooker considered a system which gives
        people "playlists" of relationships.</p>
    <h1>Plot</h1><br>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>Frank and Amy use a circular device called "Coach" that matches them with partners for fixed
                periods of time. They are matched together for 12 hours. Coach tells them the
                system monitors each relationship to assign them a lifelong partner on "pairing day",
                with a success rate of 99.8%.</p>
            <p>Frank's next match Nicola immediately dislikes him, but they are paired for a year.
                Meanwhile, Amy is paired with her nine-month match Lenny. Amy and Frank meet again,
                at an event where a couple talk about their successful pairing.
                After the relationship ends, she is repeatedly matched
                with people for 36 hours.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>After Frank's match ends, he and Amy are matched again and they agree not to check the time
                length, to avoid preconceptions.
                One night, Frank checks the expiry date. It initially says five years but recalibrates,
                as Frank's betrayal of their agreement has destabilised it, until it reads 20 hours.
                Frank is distracted the next day as Amy notices every pebble she skips hits the water four times;
                he admits what has happened with an hour remaining.
                She is furious and he is heartbroken.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <p>They continue matches to no avail. The evening before Amy's pairing day, she chooses Frank for
                her one permitted farewell session.
                At dinner with Frank, whose pairing day is also tomorrow, she encourages him to leave with her.
                Recognising that neither of them have memories prior to the system,
                she thinks the world is a test and they must rebel.
                Frank and Amy run and scale a wall that separates the outside world. The world is a simulated
                reality, one of 1000, and one of 998 in which Frank and Amy rebelled. In the real world,
                Amy's dating application says Frank is a 99.8% match and they make eye contact
                for the first time across a bar.</p>
